   Please refer to
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSSE3 for a complete list.
   While AMD processors probably work, CasparCG Server has only been tested on
   Intel processors.

2. Windows 7 (64-bit) recommended.
   CasparCG Server has also been used successfully on Windows 7 (32-bit) 
   and Windows XP SP2 (32-bit only.)
   NOT SUPPORTED: Windows 8, Windows 2003 Server and Windows Vista.

3. A graphics card (GPU) capable of OpenGL 3.0 is required.

6. Flash Player 11.8 or later must be installed.
   Included "Flash Player Installation" folder.
